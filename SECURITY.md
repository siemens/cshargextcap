# Security Policy

The Edgeshark community takes the security of its code seriously. If you think
you have found a security vulnerability, please read the next section and follow
the instructions to report your finding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel
(GitHub issue etc.). Instead, create a report via
https://github.com/siemens/edgeshark/security/advisories/new or contact the
[maintainers](.github/CODEOWNERS) via email directly. Please provide a detailed
description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, the affected versions and,
if already available, a proposal for a fix. You should receive a response within
5 working days. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability by us, we will open
a Security Advisory on github and give credits for your report if desired. This
project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
